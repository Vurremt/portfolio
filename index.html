                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Young engineer graduating in 2025 from ISIMA, specialized in Software Engineering and Computer Systems, I am passionate about developing heavy applications in the field of 3D.
                        <br><br>
                        With successful experiences in developing projects and software related to realistic 3D digital creation, I would like to continue my professional journey in this field that I deeply care about.
                        <br><br>
                        Among the most significant projects, I worked with several colleagues on our final year project: a programmable game engine with photorealistic rendering and advanced physics.
                        This project allowed me to acquire solid foundations in engine creation, handling graphic libraries and shaders, and optimizing architectures for this type of software.
                        <br><br>
                        Later, I had the opportunity to do my final internship at Adobe, specifically on the Oscar-winning texturing software: Substance 3D Designer.
                        This experience taught me a lot, both personally and professionally, and confirmed my passion for this field.
                        The internship, successfully completed and praised with a recommendation letter from my mentor, involved defining and independently developing the first version of a major feature, integrating technologies unfamiliar to the team and working with a codebase over 15 years old.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, on a more personal note, I am passionate about video games and especially game design. You can find my game design portfolio on this site.
                        That's why I'm actively looking for a developer position in the video game industry, which brings together all my passions.

                    <h2>Gutter Engine</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gutter Engine is a 3D game engine developed in C++, designed to integrate realistic rendering, credible physics simulation, and a modular architecture based on the Entity-Component-System model.
                        It offers a user interface via ImGui and allows programming independent games through a dedicated API.
                        <br><br>
                        The project was carried out as a final year project by 5 students, including myself.
                        The goal was to design a functional and flexible engine capable of supporting a demo game — in our case, a bowling simulation — while exploring current standards in 3D development.
                        <br><br>
                        The engine includes components for PBR rendering, light and shadow management, realistic physics with PhysX, and behavior programming via C++ scripts.
                        For more technical and visual details, the repository contains a complete README and illustrated examples.

                    <h2>Animated Texture (Clair Obscur)</h2>
                    <p>
                        As part of my internship, I had the chance to work on the animation feature in Substance 3D Designer.
                        <br><br>
                        Inspired by the absolutely stunning textures from Sandfall Interactive artists posted on ArtStation, and being a big fan of the studio's recently released game, I wanted to showcase the results of my internship while honoring the game and the software.
                        So, I tried to recreate, within the application and using the animation feature I developed during my internship, a texture created by Alexandre Breton.
                        The original texture was animated via Unreal Engine, but this version could be animated directly in Designer.

                    <p>
                        My greatest passion is game design. While I undoubtedly love video games, it's especially their creation and the process of imagining mechanics that has always fascinated me.
                        <br><br>
                        Having tried a game design school and read many books on the subject, I've created a few amateur projects in my free time.
                        These range from card game rules to the most challenging game jams.
                        Here you'll find a small compilation, in french, of some of my creations that I've tried to showcase.
