                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        A young engineer graduating in 2025 from ISIMA, specializing in Software Engineering and Computer Systems, I am passionate about developing applications in the fields of 3D and simulation.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        With successful experience in developing software related to 3D digital creation, including my internship at Adobe Substance 3D Designer and my final-year project on a programmable and realistic game engine, I would like to continue my professional career in this field that I am so passionate about.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Passionate about game engines, I'm learning Unreal Engine 5, first using Blueprint and then C++, in order to master the tool for professional use.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Finally, on a more personal note, I am passionate about video games and, more specifically, game design. You can find my game design portfolio on this website.
                        That's why I'm actively seeking a developer position in the video game industry, which combines all my passions.

                    <h2>Game Engine - Gutter Engine</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gutter Engine is a 3D game engine developed in C++, designed to integrate realistic rendering, credible physics simulation, and a modular architecture based on the Entity-Component-System model.
                        It offers a user interface via ImGui and allows programming independent games through a dedicated API.
                        <br><br>
                        The project was carried out as a final year project by 5 students, including myself.
                        The goal was to design a functional and flexible engine capable of supporting a demo game — in our case, a bowling simulation — while exploring current standards in 3D development.
                        <br><br>
                        The engine includes components for PBR rendering, light and shadow management, realistic physics with PhysX, and behavior programming via C++ scripts.
                        For more technical and visual details, the repository contains a complete README and illustrated examples.

                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            My current project on Unreal Engine 5 is a tech demo of a puzzle game with a time loop mechanic.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            All of the player's actions are recorded while he plays in a loop, and in the next loop, a "ghost" from his past will repeat the same actions, such as moving, interacting with objects, etc.
                            This will allow player to unlock passages by activating multiple levers simultaneously, free up sections of the map inaccessible on his own alone, and so on. All of this is within a single-player puzzle game.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Primarily developed using Blueprints, this project aims to train me in Unreal Engine 5 using C++, a language I already practice a lot, while simultaneously producing a game design and level design project that I enjoy.

                        <p>
                            I've participated in numerous Game Jams, the most recent taking place in October 2025. The theme was "Sor(t)s", a pun between "Get Out!" and "Spells" in french, leaving room for interpretation.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We created a management game set in a fantasy kingdom, where the goal was to judge criminals. Sentences were in the form of magical spells, and everything hinged on banishing the criminal by shouting "Get out!", hence the pun (in french).
                            Depending on the criminal's magical race, the other races had expectations that had to be met as best as possible, under penalty of being deposed and executed.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Using a pixel art style and a Python base (with the PyGame library), we developed a functional game in two days, which we are very proud of.

                    <p>
                        My greatest passion is game design. While I undoubtedly love video games, it's especially their creation and the process of imagining mechanics that has always fascinated me.
                        <br><br>
                        Having tried a game design school and read many books on the subject, I've created a few amateur projects in my free time.
                        These range from card game rules to the most challenging game jams.
                        Here you'll find a small compilation, in french, of some of my creations that I've tried to showcase.
